Four in a Row player: A web-player in JavaScript and HTML that allows two players to take turn in a game of four-in-a-row, consisting of a board where stones "falls with gravity", and stones stack on top of one another. An automated score counter announces the winner and displays ending messages when a game ends, in which case four stones of the same color are adjacent to one another either diagonally, horizontally or vertically.
